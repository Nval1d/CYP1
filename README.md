# This is a 12 character password generator I have created and modified for a class project. The goal was to create a window that would prompt a user to click and generate a random 12 Character complex password. Another button was created to copy that password to your clipboard and also prompt that it was copied. The variables can also be changed in the code to a different fixed length to suit your password needs. This is my first Github repo, and im not an expert in python code. Through exposure, I intedn to get better!!
